## What is a Botnet?

A botnet is a number of Internet-connected devices, each of which runs one (or more) bots.

For more info on what a botnet is please vist https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet

## Features

Features here

## Getting started?

- Download the bot from **https://github.com/Souhardya/UBoat/releases**
- Follow the wiki at **https://github.com/Souhardya/UBoat/wiki**

## How?

botnet-controller uses php to host servers locally and uses ngrok to port forward. From there it then grabs the ngrok url and adds it in the botnet malware, which takes orders from the main server (your pc, or wherever the controller is running). The bots then requsts the url and do the task specified to them.

## Some additional notes
This software will only work for botnets generated by this software, spreading the malware is to be done by the user.
