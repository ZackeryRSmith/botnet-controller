# botnet-controller
A controller and managment software for botnets

# Brief Working
This program is used to control a botnet. It uses php to host servers locally and uses ngrok to port forward. 
It then grabs the ngrok url and adds it in the botnet malware, which takes orders from the main server(where the controller is running)
The bots then requst the url and do the task specidied to them

# Detailed working
Going through the progam should work lol.


The user doesn't really have to do anything, i have tried to make the program as easy as possible.

# Note
this only works for botnets made by this software, its only work is to make botnet malware and manage botnet. spreading the botnet malware after
creating it is done by the user or other means. Cant expect the program to do everything.

i am not responsible for your dipshit or what you do with this program
